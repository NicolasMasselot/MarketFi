Notebook 1 (01_pricing_intro.ipynb): Using pricing.py, plots call price vs. strike and call price vs. volatility to illustrate pricing sensitivities.

Notebook 2 (02_greeks_visualisation.ipynb): Using greeks.py, plots Greeks as functions of the spot price to show how risk measures evolve with the underlying.
